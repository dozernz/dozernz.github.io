I gave a talk at DEF CON 30 this year, titled Hunting Bugs In The Tropics. It covered a few years of my security research on Aruba Networks products, including the software in use on several of their popular products, as well as architectural details, and a whole lot of vulnerabilities.

The talk slides are [available here (PDF)](/uploads/Hunting Bugs in The Tropics - DC30.pdf), and the recording of the talk is on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMgXtuJdP3c):
