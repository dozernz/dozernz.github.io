I'm Daniel, also known as dozer. I'm an information security researcher, penetration tester, and occasional red teamer based in New Zealand. Currently I work as a penetration tester at a cybersecurity consultancy, pursue personal security research projects, as well as take part in bug bounties through Bugcrowd and Hackerone.
