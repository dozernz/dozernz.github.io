I'm Daniel, also known as dozer. I'm an information security researcher, penetration tester, and occasional red teamer based in New Zealand. Currently I work as a penetration tester at a cybersecurity consultancy, pursue personal security research projects, as well as take part in bug bounties through Bugcrowd and Hackerone.  You can contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/dozernz)

### About this site
dozer.nz uses jekyll's minima theme, loaded from the github repo to take advantage of the dark theme that hasn't made its way into the Github pages gem yet. It is hosted as a Github page, and fronted by Cloudflare for TLS, speed, and a proper domain. It uses the excellent [instant page](https://instant.page/) script in mousedown mode to speed up navigation clicks.
