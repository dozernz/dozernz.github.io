I'm Daniel, also known as dozer. I'm an information security researcher, penetration tester, and occasional red teamer. Currently I'm pursuing personal security research projects, as well as taking part in bug bounties through Bugcrowd and Hackerone. 

I'm also currently travelling around Asia, with a healthy mix of work and adventure. You can contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/dozernz)
